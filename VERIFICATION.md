# Verification Notes

Date: 2025-10-05 04:01:46Z

## Environment
- Base image: Codespaces Ubuntu container (non-systemd)
- Shim commands: `tests/bin/apt-get`, `tests/bin/systemctl`, `tests/bin/raspi-config`, `tests/bin/git-clone-stub`
- Additional setup: created `pi` user and symlinked the Git stub into `/usr/local/bin`

## Procedure
1. Exported `PATH="$(pwd)/tests/bin:$PATH"` so the shims masked missing utilities.
2. Ran the installer with a custom frequency to ensure CLI flag parsing works:
   `SUDO_USER=pi ./a2dp2fm.sh --freq 99.1`.
3. Confirmed that configuration and service files were emitted with the requested values.

## Results
- Installer completed without error and printed the expected success banner.【60fb9f†L1-L34】
- `/etc/default/bt2fm` captured the custom frequency range values.【12d0b5†L1-L4】
- `bt2fm.service` references the generated runtime script under the pi user.【16c7d8†L1-L13】
- Helper scripts such as `/usr/local/bin/bt2fm.sh` were generated with BlueALSA wait logic.【f978fe†L1-L12】

These results show that the installer successfully renders its configuration and service
artifacts when executed in a clean environment.
